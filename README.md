## What is this?

This is the GitHub repository where all of the source files for this game are stored. If you are just here to play, you don't need to worry about any of the files in the table above. Just navigate to https://github.com/rainpaw/Conditional-Switch/releases and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

## Why did you decide to do this?

I made this because I really like programming, and this idea had been floating around in my head for a while. I finally got around to creating it, and I learned a lot along the way.

## How long did this take you?

This took my way longer than I thought, and it consumed a lot of time over the past couple of months.

##  I found a bug. Where can I report this?

Great job! You can report bugs here: https://github.com/rainpaw/Conditional-Switch/issues . This is also where you can request features and ideas for the game in the future.

## What features are you planning on adding?

I plan to add some sound, because currently there isn't any music or sound effects and those are a big part of any game. I also plan to add a personal and possibly global highscore list where you can see what your past scores have been.

Thanks for reading down this far, and enjoy the game Conditional Switch!
