# >original: if p is true then q is true
# ~inverse: if p is not true then q is not true
# +converse: if q is true then p is true
# -contrapositive: if q is not true then p is not true
# /biconditional: p is true if and only if q is true

# I don't think that this one is actually usable because the first statement is not necessarily true.

=["If a triangle has a 90 degree angle, it is a right triangle."|"If a triangle does not have a 90 degree angle, it is not a right triangle."|"If a triangle is a right triangle, it has a 90 degree angle."|"If a triangle is not a right triangle, it does not have a 90 degree angle."|"A triangle has a 90 degree angle if and only if it is a right triangle."]
>["The original conditional statement is true because a triangle that has a 90 degree angle must be a right triangle. A right triangle has an angle that is made up of two lines that are perpendicular, and this is the definition of a 90 degree angle."]
~["The inverse of the original conditional statement is true because any triangle that has a 90 degree angle is a right triangle by definition. Therefore, a triangle without a 90 degree angle must not be a right triangle."]
+["The converse of the original conditional statement is true because a right triangle must have a 90 degree angle as one of its angles. This is the definition of a right triangle."]
-["The contrapositive of the original conditional statement is true because unless a triangle is a right triangle, it cannot have a 90 degree angle. A right triangle is a triangle with a 90 degree angle, so any triangle that does not have that 90 degree angle cannot be a right triangle."]
/["The biconditional of the original conditional statement is true because a triangle can only 90 degree angle if it is a right triangle. Any other type of triangle cannot have a 90 degree angle in it, because then it would be a right triangle."]
